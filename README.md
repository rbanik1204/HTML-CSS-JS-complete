## 📖 Introduction  

This repository is a **comprehensive collection of practice projects, experiments, and exercises** I’ve created while learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It reflects my journey of becoming a **frontend developer**, starting from basic HTML tags to building interactive projects with **JavaScript and APIs**.  

Whether you're a beginner looking for examples, or just curious about my learning path, this repo will give you a **hands-on view of web development fundamentals**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **HTML5** → Structure and content of the webpages  
- **CSS3** → Styling, responsive layouts, animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** → Dynamic behavior, DOM control, API handling  
- **Git & GitHub** → Version control and collaboration
